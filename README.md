#  Enhancing Digital Government and Economy(EDGE)

This repository contains a collection of projects developed during my **Python Training Program** conducted under the **EDGE (Enhancing Digital Government and Economy)** project of the **Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC)**, ICT Division.  

During this training, I learned the fundamentals of Python programming, data handling, and machine learning concepts.  
Each project in this repository reflects the skills and knowledge gained through practical exercises and guided learning sessions.

## 🏢 About EDGE Project

**Enhancing Digital Government and Economy (EDGE)** is a project of the **Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC)** under the **ICT Division**, jointly funded by the **World Bank** and the **Government of Bangladesh (GoB)**.  

The EDGE project aims to establish an **integrated, cloud-computing digital platform** for all government agencies and strengthen **cyber-security** infrastructure across the public sector.  
It is expected to save around **$200 million** in IT investments and enhance the government's capacity to deliver **virtual public services** efficiently during future crises.  

This training program was designed to enhance digital skills and promote the development of a skilled IT workforce for Bangladesh’s growing digital economy.
